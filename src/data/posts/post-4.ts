    <p>Your Secundus Dermis tee represents a significant investment in quality, comfort, and innovation. With proper care, this premium garment will maintain its luxurious feel, perfect fit, and functional properties for years to come. Here's everything you need to know about caring for your investment.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Your Fabric</h2>
    
    <p>Before diving into care instructions, it's important to understand what makes Secundus Dermis special:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Silk (40%):</strong> Provides natural temperature regulation and luxurious feel</li>
      <li><strong>Organic Cotton (35%):</strong> Offers breathability and softness</li>
      <li><strong>Spandex (20%):</strong> Ensures stretch and recovery for perfect fit</li>
      <li><strong>Ice-Cotton (5%):</strong> Adds cooling properties</li>
      <li><strong>Silver Infusion:</strong> Provides antimicrobial properties throughout the fabric</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each component requires specific care to maintain its properties and extend the garment's life.</p>
    
    <h2>Daily Care Routine</h2>
    
    <h3>After Each Wear</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Air Out:</strong> Hang your tee in a well-ventilated area for 30 minutes before storing</li>
      <li><strong>Check for Stains:</strong> Address any spots immediately for easier removal</li>
      <li><strong>Proper Storage:</strong> Hang or fold carefully to prevent wrinkles and maintain shape</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Between Wears</h3>
    <p>Thanks to the silver infusion, your Secundus Dermis tee naturally resists odors and bacteria, meaning you can often wear it multiple times before washing—extending its life and reducing environmental impact.</p>
    
    <h2>Washing Instructions</h2>
    
    <h3>Frequency</h3>
    <p>Wash only when necessary. The antimicrobial properties mean you can wear your tee 2-3 times before washing, depending on activity level and personal preference.</p>
    
    <h3>Pre-Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stain Removal:</strong> Treat stains immediately with cold water and gentle, enzyme-free detergent</li>
      <li><strong>Deodorant Marks:</strong> Use white vinegar on a soft cloth to gently remove buildup</li>
      <li><strong>Oil Stains:</strong> Blot (don't rub) with cornstarch, let sit for 10 minutes, then brush off before washing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Machine Washing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Always use cold water (30°C/86°F or below)</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle:</strong> Gentle or delicate cycle only</li>
      <li><strong>Load Size:</strong> Wash with similar colors and fabrics, avoid overloading</li>
      <li><strong>Detergent:</strong> Use gentle, sulfate-free detergent—avoid fabric softeners</li>
      <li><strong>Special Consideration:</strong> Turn inside out to protect the outer surface</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Hand Washing (Recommended)</h3>
    <p>For maximum longevity, hand washing is ideal:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a clean basin with cold water</li>
      <li>Add a small amount of gentle detergent</li>
      <li>Submerge the tee and gently agitate for 2-3 minutes</li>
      <li>Let soak for 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Rinse thoroughly with cold water until no soap remains</li>
      <li>Gently squeeze (never wring) to remove excess water</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Drying Guidelines</h2>
    
    <h3>Air Drying (Preferred)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Method:</strong> Lay flat on a clean towel or hang on padded hangers</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Away from direct sunlight and heat sources</li>
      <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Gently reshape while damp to maintain fit</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Allow 4-6 hours for complete drying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Machine Drying (If Necessary)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heat Setting:</strong> Low heat only</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Remove while slightly damp to prevent over-drying</li>
      <li><strong>Dryer Sheets:</strong> Avoid—they can interfere with the silver infusion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
    
    <h3>Detergents and Chemicals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bleach:</strong> Never use bleach—it will damage the silver infusion and fabric fibers</li>
      <li><strong>Fabric Softeners:</strong> These coat fibers and reduce the effectiveness of silver ions</li>
      <li><strong>Harsh Detergents:</strong> Avoid products with sulfates, phosphates, or optical brighteners</li>
      <li><strong>Dry Cleaning:</strong> The chemicals used can damage the specialized fabric blend</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Heat and Mechanical Damage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hot Water:</strong> Can cause shrinkage and damage to spandex fibers</li>
      <li><strong>High Heat Drying:</strong> Breaks down spandex and can affect silver infusion</li>
      <li><strong>Wringing:</strong> Can stretch and damage the fabric structure</li>
      <li><strong>Rough Handling:</strong> Avoid aggressive scrubbing or stretching</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Stain Removal Guide</h2>
    
    <h3>Common Stains and Solutions</h3>
    
    <h4>Sweat and Deodorant</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-treat with white vinegar solution (1:1 with water)</li>
      <li>Let sit for 30 minutes before washing</li>
      <li>The silver infusion helps prevent odor retention</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Food and Beverage</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Blot immediately—don't rub</li>
      <li>Rinse with cold water from the back of the fabric</li>
      <li>Pre-treat with gentle detergent before washing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Makeup and Cosmetics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use makeup remover or micellar water on a cotton pad</li>
      <li>Gently dab the stain—work from outside in</li>
      <li>Rinse with cold water and wash as usual</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Oil-Based Stains</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Sprinkle with cornstarch or baby powder</li>
      <li>Let absorb for 10-15 minutes</li>
      <li>Brush off powder and pre-treat with gentle detergent</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Storage Best Practices</h2>
    
    <h3>Short-Term Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hanging:</strong> Use padded or wide hangers to maintain shape</li>
      <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Fold along natural lines, avoid sharp creases</li>
      <li><strong>Space:</strong> Allow air circulation—don't pack tightly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Long-Term Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean First:</strong> Always wash before long-term storage</li>
      <li><strong>Breathable Containers:</strong> Use cotton garment bags, not plastic</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Cool, dry place away from direct light</li>
      <li><strong>Cedar Protection:</strong> Use cedar blocks to deter insects naturally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Maintaining the Silver Infusion</h2>
    
    <p>The antimicrobial silver infusion is a key feature of your Secundus Dermis tee. To maintain its effectiveness:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gentle Washing:</strong> Harsh chemicals can reduce silver ion effectiveness</li>
      <li><strong>Proper pH:</strong> Use pH-neutral detergents to preserve silver properties</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Chlorine:</strong> Swimming pools and bleach can damage silver infusion</li>
      <li><strong>Regular Care:</strong> Proper washing actually helps redistribute silver ions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Extending Garment Life</h2>
    
    <h3>Rotation Strategy</h3>
    <p>If you love your Secundus Dermis tee (and who wouldn't?), consider having multiple pieces to rotate. This allows each garment to rest between wears, extending overall life.</p>
    
    <h3>Professional Care</h3>
    <p>For special situations or if you're unsure about a stain, consult a professional cleaner experienced with luxury fabrics. Always inform them about the silver infusion and fabric blend.</p>
    
    <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
    
    <h3>Loss of Shape</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Proper washing and drying techniques</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Gently reshape while damp and lay flat to dry</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Pilling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Wash inside out, avoid rough surfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a fabric shaver or pill comb gently</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Color Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Avoid direct sunlight and high heat</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Some slight color evolution is normal with natural fibers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
    
    <p>Proper care isn't just about preserving your investment—it's also about environmental responsibility:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reduced Washing:</strong> The antimicrobial properties mean less frequent washing</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Water:</strong> Saves energy and reduces environmental impact</li>
      <li><strong>Air Drying:</strong> Eliminates dryer energy use</li>
      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Proper care extends garment life, reducing waste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
    
    <p>Contact customer service or a professional if you experience:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Persistent stains that don't respond to gentle treatment</li>
      <li>Significant shape changes or fit issues</li>
      <li>Questions about specific care situations</li>
      <li>Damage from improper care</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <p>Your Secundus Dermis tee is designed to be a long-term investment in your comfort and confidence. With proper care, it will maintain its luxurious feel, perfect fit, and innovative properties for years to come.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the goal isn't just to clean your garment—it's to preserve all the qualities that make it special. By following these guidelines, you're ensuring that your investment continues to provide the comfort, support, and confidence you deserve, day after day.</p>
